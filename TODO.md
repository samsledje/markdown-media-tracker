- If OMDB API key runs out of authorization (too many calls in a day), warn the user
- General performance optimization on imports
- Specific performance optimization for Google Drive
- Cover-fetch option for missing covers, it searches just the title, grabs the first element, takes that cover URL, and applies it
- Sometimes hotkeys seem to just break?
- Add loading/progress bar for large batch edits

- Have implemented solution for OMDB key failure, but only moderately tested

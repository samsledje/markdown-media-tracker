# My Thoughts

*1984* is a **masterpiece** of dystopian literature. Orwell's vision of a totalitarian future remains chillingly relevant today.

## Main Themes

1. **Surveillance state** - Big Brother watches everything
2. **Propaganda** - The Ministry of Truth rewrites history
3. **Thought control** - Even thinking rebellious thoughts is a crime

## Memorable Concepts

- **Doublethink**: Holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously
- **Newspeak**: Language designed to limit freedom of thought
- **Room 101**: Everyone's worst nightmare

> "War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength."

## Writing Style

Orwell's prose is *deliberately* spare and unflinching. He doesn't romanticize rebellion or offer easy answers.

### Impact

This book influenced:
- Modern discussions of privacy
- Political discourse
- Literature and film (countless dystopian works)

**Rating Justification**: A stark, prophetic warning that every generation should read. While bleak, it's essential reading for understanding power, control, and resistance.
